# Security Home Lab for Training 
Documenting the process for setting up a home lab for security training for myself and those looking to get into Information Security/Cybersecurity. 

## Overview 
This project will mainly provide resources I used during my initial setup to create a virtualized segmented environment within my home network. Virtualization will be a big part of this lab but it will be locally hosted. 

## Network Diagram (Mine)
This is the visual representation of my security lab environment. It is not completely finished so I will continue to make updates to this image.
